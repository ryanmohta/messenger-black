## Scheduling: Customizable to your schedule. Or the Sun's.
Messenger Black features three modes designed to help you get the most out of Dark Mode, whatever your uses might be.

🎛 Manual: Put yourself in full control with a single switch to enable or disable Messenger Black. Useful if you want to always have Dark Mode on.

⏰ Scheduled: Set a start and stop time from which you want Messenger Black to run. Useful if you want to align Messenger Black with your own schedule or home automation system.

🌅 Sunset to Sunrise: Our most sophisticated mode yet, Sunset to Sunrise automatically turns Messenger Black on at sunset and off at sunrise, matching your circadian rhythm and the surrounding environment.

Each of these features can be enabled or disabled from a convenient control panel in the Safari toolbar.
